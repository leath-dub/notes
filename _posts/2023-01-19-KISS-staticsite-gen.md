I am not bothered to learn a framework like HUGO or jeykll. Just use go
templates and [lowdown](https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown)

# Requirements
* support for inserting snippets of html
* markup for markdown files
* picocss loaded by default
* It should be simple but at the core have the same effect of a static
  site generator

# Contraints
* Reduce need for knowledge of the system
  - No specific directories you need to know to use the framework
    ( it will all be just using relative paths , you can abstract on that if you like )
